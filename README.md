# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation Tool

A Python-based tool to evaluate password strength using **hashing (SHA-256)** and **entropy logic**.  
This project helps users understand how secure their passwords are and prevents dictionary-based weak passwords.

---

## 📜 Features

✅ Calculates password entropy (bit-level strength)  
✅ Detects weak and common passwords (dictionary attack prevention)  
✅ Uses SHA-256 hashing for secure password representation  
✅ Gives clear strength labels: Weak | Moderate | Strong | Very Strong  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters a password.  
2. The tool checks:
   - Length and complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
   - Dictionary-based weak passwords
   - Entropy score  
3. Displays:
   - SHA-256 hash of the password
   - Entropy value (in bits)
   - Strength rating
## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/password-strength-tool.git
   Open the folder in PyCharm or VS Code.

   Run the Python file:
   python3 pass.py
   Enter any password and check the strength
